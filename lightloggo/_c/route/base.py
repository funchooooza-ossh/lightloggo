"""
Internal C-level wrapper for the Route Processor resource.

This module provides the CRouteProcessor class, which interfaces with the FFI
layer. It creates and manages a "route" instanceâ€”a fundamental routing rule
that links a minimum log level to a specific formatter and writer pair.

class CRouteProcessor:
    """
    A low-level handle to a route processor resource in the Go core.

    This class is an internal component and not intended for direct use.
    It represents a single, complete processing pipeline for a log message:
    if a message's level is at or above the specified threshold, it will be
    processed by the given formatter and sent to the given writer.

    Multiple CRouteProcessor instances can be combined to create a complex
    logger with multiple outputs (e.g., INFO to stdout, ERROR to a file).

    Attributes:
        _id (int): The unique identifier/handle for the native route resource.
