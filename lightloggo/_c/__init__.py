"""
Internal C-Level Abstraction Package.

This package, conventionally named `_c` (for "core" or "C-level"),
encapsulates all direct interactions with the native Go shared library,
building upon the low-level FFI bindings.

The primary responsibility of this layer is to provide a one-to-one mapping
of Python objects to resources (loggers, writers, formatters, etc.)
managed by the Go core. Each class within this package typically acts as a
"handle manager"â€”its main purpose is to acquire a unique resource ID from
the native library upon instantiation and hold it for its lifetime.

This entire package is a private, internal implementation detail of the
lightloggo library. Its structure and components are subject to change and
are NOT part of the public API.
